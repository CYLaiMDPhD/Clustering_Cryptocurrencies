# Cryptocurrencies

*Note: This repository was created to fulfill an assignment (Module 18 Challenge) for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Submitted on 2-25-22 for grading.*


## Overview
This project demonstrates some fundamental steps in unsupervised machine learning using the SciKit Learn module and a sample dataset of cryptocurrency trading metrics. The data was cleaned, transformed, and scaled using pandas. Feature dimensions were reduced by principle component analysis. Finally, a kmeans algorithm as applied to cluster data into four clusters and visualized using hvplot. 


**Data Source:** 
A dataset of crytocurrency trading data provided by course as csv file.
